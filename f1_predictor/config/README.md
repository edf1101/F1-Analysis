### config.json
This file contains basic configuration settings for the project.
- "season_train_start": The first season to train the model on
- "season_train_end": The last season (inclusive) to train the model on
- "path_to_excludes": The path (relative to config directory) to the file containing the list of 
races we want to exclude from the training data

### excludes.txt
This file contains the races that we don't want to include in the training data. This is useful for excluding outliers.

It is formatted so each Race we want to exclude is on a new line. The format is Season(int), Race(String) 
eg. 2021, "Monaco".
